Hello!

I put this module together to hopefully make running games for the server just a little bit easier. If you do choose to install it, please send me a message on discord MaxPat#7936 so that I can let you know when the module is updated! 


I recommend also installing Compendium Folders (https://foundryvtt.com/packages/compendium-folders) as I have built folders in the Guild Features compendium to make it easier to sort.

This module includes:
Guild Features
Journals for MIT links
Roll tables for Reward Items

Things that still need to be done:
Guild features actions
Please send recommendations!
