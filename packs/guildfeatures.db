Inside our halls there exists a small group of children and animals which, for different reasons, have decided to become adventurers and animal companions in the future. For that they have been instructed in the ways of adventuring and given a special Ward which helps them experience these situations without major dangers. After gaining the trust of the guild master you can adopt one of these Protegees with goals similar to yours, allowing them to accompany you in your adventures and providing them with a safe place to return.

People hire us because of our sterling reputation: we are the best of the best when it comes to killing powerful creatures (due to our specialized training). Like our name implies, we will not accept work that helps monsters. Although there are people who try to hire us by claiming that \"humanoids are the true monsters\", we will not accept contracts on humanoids. When we are hired to kill a monster or group of monsters, we expect our members to do the job and slay monsters - after all, we are being hired to do so and not befriend them. If we encounter monsters other than the ones we are being hired to kill while on a quest, we expect our members to use their best judgement - it is not always necessary to slay all monsters that are not essential to the contract. Sometimes, giving minor aid to sentient monsters in exchange for assistance with the contract is in fact helpful to the completion of said contract.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Note: most importantly, we do not befriend our prey.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>@Compendium[d-n-d-friends-guilds.guildfeatures.Z7a704YznI2cTk2m]{Monster Slayers 1 - Slayer's Elixir}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[d-n-d-friends-guilds.guildfeatures.5a7jriGHjlq7F1kj]{Monster Slayers 1 - Slayer's Warning}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[d-n-d-friends-guilds.guildfeatures.odgyNfy4mtRY21o4]{Monster Slayers 2 - Gambits of the Hunt}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[d-n-d-friends-guilds.guildfeatures.xi7dIpvc3tuU5Y75]{Monster Slayers 2 - Tonics}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[d-n-d-friends-guilds.guildfeatures.1AfUzKG7nmqQACb2]{Monster Slayers 2 - Tools}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[d-n-d-friends-guilds.guildfeatures.v2WndUlo1ycjHETF]{Monster Slayers 3 - Journal of the Hunt}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[d-n-d-friends-guilds.guildfeatures.AAHMiuOrXeh1VWqg]{Monster Slayers 3 - Slayer's Bane}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[d-n-d-friends-guilds.guildfeatures.cSc07olTkHKKYm22]{Monster Slayers 4 - Slayer's Nightmare}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"57sUkRQ7zKNhpeEE":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_om2h4rpbkvn","path":"Guild Features#/CF_SEP/Monster Slayers","color":"#000000"}}}
